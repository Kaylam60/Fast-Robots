Welcome to my Fast Robots page! This is a work in progress

# Lab 1: Introduction to Artemis 
## Part 1
Goal: To test Artemis board functionality, by testing the LED, Temperature sensor, Serial output, and microphone.
### Prelab

### "Example 1: Blink it Up"
The “Blink it Up” example was used for this portion of the lab. The code, when compiled would turn the LED on for a specified amount of time, then would turn it off. Below is the result:
### "Example 4: Analog Read"
This example  was used to test the temperature sensor on the Artemis board.  The test would send the temperature reading and time to the serial monitor and would slightly change the temperature number as I applied either a touch or breath method. ( Change is tiny, about 0.2, likely due to the surrounding room temperature being warmer than usual)
### "Example 2: Serial"
This example found under Artemis examples, was used to test the serial monitor output. It would print out any messages that were typed in the input space, as seen in the image below.
### "PDM/Example 1: Microphone Output"
The microphone output example was used to show the frequencies picked up by the Artemis board. There would be a slight change as I released a higher-pitched whistle in time and would decrease as I stopped. Below is an image and video of this:
## Part 2: Bluetooth Setup
The objective of this part of the lab was to establish a Bluetooth connection between the Artemis board and the computer and to indicate its functionality. In this section, we worked in tandem with both Arduino and Python (using Jupiter lab) to connect the Artemis through Bluetooth, then send data to the board over Bluetooth as well
